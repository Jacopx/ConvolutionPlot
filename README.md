# ConvolutionPlot
Convolution plotter for 2 signals written for MATLAB by Jacopx

#Usage
You can use every function defined in MATLAB but you must to pay attention to the bound (a,b) of the system, they must be bigger than the real dimension of the convolution, you can start from the double of the bigger support of the signal used and progressi reduce it. 

#Output Example
Convolution of 2 Rectangular signal.
